            <h2 className="heading_secondary">A <strong>Web Developer</strong> who enjoys exploring new technologies through Project-Based learning.</h2>
            <p>I started programming about 4 years ago, and much of my professional experience comes from agencies working in the automotive space. I'm comfortable working with traditional web building blocks like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript(<strong>ES6+</strong>, JQuery), PHP, MySQL, and WordPress, but in my freetime I like working primarily with modern JavaScript, building projects using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Node</strong>. Have a look around, you might see something you like.</p>
